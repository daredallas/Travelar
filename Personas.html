<h2>Personas</h2>
<p id="main-paragraph">For this project we have chosen 4 different personas to help guide us through the design. </p>

<br>
<br>




<img class="avatar" src=images/abcde-avatar.jpeg alt="Avatar">
		<h3>Abcde</h3>
		<p id="main-paragraph">Abcde (pronounced Ab-city) is a 21-year-old woman from Toronto who works for a marketing business with clients around the world. Her job has her travelling to different places every month and her biggest problem is the language barrier she encounters as a unilingual english speaker. One of her favourite hobbies while on trips is to indulge in the local cuisine and is always looking for new food to try out. Abcde does not focus on technology very much even though she can use her computer and smartphone without issue. She would love to find a way to fit more interesting food experiences into her busy travel schedule.  </p>

		<h3>Gunther</h3>
		<p id="main-paragraph">Gunther is a 27-year-old travel blogger from Hamburg, Germany. He has travelled many places and takes pride in his self-taught history knowledge. Often offered payment or free experiences, he takes every opportunity to expand the content on his social media. Gunther’s travels result in him frequently finding himself trying out acclaimed restaurants and exciting attractions. He is familiar with technology, but often opts to use classic travel media such as physical maps rather than his phone. However, he has noticed the limitations of physical travel media recently and is interested in smart solutions to his frequent travel needs.

		<h3>Karen</h3>
		<p id="main-paragraph">Karen is a 60-year-old woman who works as a manager at Walmart in Montgomery, Alabama. An infrequent traveller, Karen has never left the United States before. Karen and her sister Barbara always talk about taking more trips and hope to travel internationally soon. She does not consider herself a tech savvy person and is fascinated when she is shown her smartphone can do things beyond Facebook, calling, and texting. Karen has downloaded a handful of apps she has seen mentioned on television but struggles with any complicated instructions.  </p>

		<h3>Bobby</h3>
		<p id="main-paragraph">Bobby is a 10-year-old student from Vancouver, BC. Not yet in charge of his own travel experiences, Bobby’s experiences are governed by his parent’s choice of vacation. He loves to download every app that looks fun to use on his smartphone and is easily entertained by game like features. Bobby is a curious person and has often has locations catch his eye while travelling which his parents don’t have time to stop for. He wants to be able to report on everything he sees to raise the chance his parents will take him there.
