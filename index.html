<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="p">
			
			<p>Tourism is an enormous industry and with the prevalence of phones and access to information throughout the world, it is easier for people to experience different cultures. However, difference in familiarity can be a problem when exploring new locations and since many people have phones, it could be used to proliferate the at least the minimum information for their travels. With an augmented reality travel app, the goal is to provide an easily usable application for travellers and providing just enough information for travellers to have an enjoyable experience. </p>
