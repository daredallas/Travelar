<h2>Usability Goals</h2>
			
			
<h3>Effectiveness</h3>
<p id="main-paragraph">
Although maps are useful, those without a sense of direction might not be able to recognise locations or directions. The augmented reality travel app allows for quick visual feedback on where to go or what they’re looking at through their perspective. </p>
<h3>Efficiency</h3> 
<p id="main-paragraph">
Automatically grabs geographical data from an internet connection or gps if active and should load relative information quickly when used. </p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p id="main-paragraph">
User’s individual information will not be accessible but aggregated data will be collected and anonymized to improve the services.
</p>
<h3>Learnability</h3>
<p id="main-paragraph">
Easy to use gyroscopic controls that is essentially the same as pointing a camera or looking at an object. Simple tappable prompts for location information.
</p>
<h3>Criteria</h3> 
<p id="main-paragraph">
Time to complete a task, time to learn a task, number of errors made.
</p>

<h2>User experience goals</h2> 
<h3>Satisfaction</h3> 
<p id="main-paragraph">Finds the correct information. </p>


<h3>Enjoyment</h3>
